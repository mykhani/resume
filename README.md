# Resume using Latex

Finally after years of using office suites, I have ventured
into exploring Latex for creating my resume, and as expected, I am instantly
hooked.

This might be due to the fact that I have always enjoyed writing documents in the
markdown format, and there is something about the process of transforming the raw commands
and text into beautifully formatted documents, that I find quite satisfying. So
naturally, I found the Latex's workflow to be similar and equally enjoyable.

Since this is my first attempt at writing a document in Latex, I have tried to keep it as
simple as possible, by using minimum external packages.

# Compiling the Latex file

For compiling the Latex file to the pdf, I have used the Texmaker software running
on ubuntu. Here's the link: https://www.xm1math.net/texmaker.

Just simply open the tex file in texmaker and run the default "Quick Build" tool.
