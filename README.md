# Resume using Latex
Finally after years of using office suites to create my resume, I have ventured
in to exploring Latex for creating my resume and not surprisingly, I got instantly
hooked. 

This might be due to the fact that I have always enjoyed writing documents in the 
markdown format and there is something about the process of converting the raw commands
and text into beautifully formatted output documents that I find satisfactory. So
naturally, I found the Latex's workflow to be similar and equally enjoyable.

Since this is my first ever document written in Latex, I have tried to keep it as
simple as possible, using as less external packages as possible.

# Compiling the Latex file
For compiling the Latex file to the pdf, I have used the Texmaker software running
on ubuntu. Here's the link: https://www.xm1math.net/texmaker.

Just simply open the tex file in texmaker and run the default "Quick Build" tool.
