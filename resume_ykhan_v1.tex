\section{Projects}
\liststart

\project{Custom USB device and its Linux driver:}
        {Developed a custom USB device on ARM cortex-M4
         based Texas Instruments TM4C123G microcontroller.     
         TM4C123G USB controller provides USB OTG
         functionality but it was programmed to be in the device mode.
         Wireshark was used to observe USB packets during USB enumeration,
         configuration and data transfer phases. Two endpoints (IN and OUT) were configured on the device side to communicate with the USB host during
         interrupt transfers. Finally, wrote a Linux driver to communicate
         with the device. Link to source: \textbf {http://github.com/mykhani/usbdev} }

\project{STM32RTOS:}
        {My personal project of creating an RTOS from scratch for STM32 series ARM Cortex M4 microcontrollers. See \textbf {https://github.com/mykhani/STM32RTOS} for details and the features implemented so far (priority based scheduling, build system).}

\project{IoT based hydroponic farming:} 
        {Developed a prototype for IoT based 
         hydroponic farming system. Wrote RTOS based firmware
         for the system components; including a custom designed wireless environment sensor, 
         LED grow light brightness and color control, and automatic nutrient monitoring/feeding
         system. Also setup a local mqtt web server to listen in on the field devices and store the transmitted data.}
         
\project{Beaglebone Green Product Review:}
        {Reviewed the BeagleBone Green board for Element14. Explored creating a platform for robotics based development using Beaglebone Green, Robot Operating System (ROS), and the Grove connector system of the Beagleboard Green. The review and some of my other technical blogs can be read at \textbf {https://medium.com/@yasir.gandapur}}
                  
\project{Autonomous air-boat:} 
        {Worked on the development of an air-boat including its mechanical
         assembly and electronics. Integrated electronics
         and sensors and implemented a PID based control software
         for GPS navigation. Conducted extensive experimental testing
         of the boat in a public lake.}
